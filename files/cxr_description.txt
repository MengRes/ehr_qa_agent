subject_id: Unique identifier for each patient in the dataset.
study_id: Unique identifier for each radiological study (exam), such as a chest X-ray, associated with a specific patient.
Atelectasis: Label indicating whether atelectasis (partial or complete lung collapse) is present in the study.
Cardiomegaly: Label indicating whether cardiomegaly (enlarged heart) is observed in the study.
Consolidation: Label indicating whether lung consolidation (accumulation of fluid in the lung tissues) is present.
Edema: Label indicating the presence of edema (fluid accumulation in the lungs).
Enlarged Cardiomediastinum: Label indicating whether the mediastinum (central part of the chest cavity) is enlarged.
Fracture: Label indicating whether any fractures are observed.
Lung Lesion: Label indicating the presence of any lesions in the lung.
Lung Opacity: Label indicating any opacity (cloudiness) detected in the lung area.
No Finding: Label indicating that no abnormalities were found in the study.
Pleural Effusion: Label indicating the presence of pleural effusion (fluid buildup between the tissues lining the lungs and chest).
Pleural Other: Label indicating other findings related to the pleura (the lining around the lungs) that donâ€™t fall into standard categories.
Pneumonia: Label indicating whether pneumonia (infection of the lung) is present.
Pneumothorax: Label indicating the presence of pneumothorax (air in the chest cavity that causes lung collapse).
Support Devices: Label indicating whether any support devices, like catheters or pacemakers, are visible in the image.
ViewPosition: The positioning of the patient when the image was taken (e.g., PA for posterior-anterior, or AP for anterior-posterior).
StudyDate: The date when the radiological study was performed.
StudyTime: The time when the radiological study was performed.
path: Path to the image file for the chest X-ray in the dataset.
report_path: Path to the radiology report associated with the chest X-ray.
